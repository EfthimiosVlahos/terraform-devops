# Terraform Zero to Hero Course

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey through the "Terraform Zero to Hero" course. This course is a crucial step in my professional development, enhancing my understanding of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Course Overview

In this immersive, week-long course, I explore everything from the fundamentals of Terraform to advanced concepts such as state management and integration with external tools like HashiCorp Vault.

## Day 1: Getting Started with Terraform

### Introduction to Terraform and IaC
I started by learning the fundamental concepts of Terraform and why managing infrastructure through IaC is both effective and necessary in todayâ€™s tech landscape.

### Installing Terraform on MacOS, Linux, and Windows
I installed Terraform on multiple operating systems, familiarizing myself with the setup processes to ensure a wide range of compatibility.

### Setting up Terraform for AWS
My focus was on integrating Terraform with AWS, setting up my AWS credentials, and configuring the AWS provider to begin provisioning resources.

### Writing Your First Terraform Code
I wrote my first Terraform code, learning about the structure of Terraform configuration files and defining resources using the HCL language.

### Terraform Lifecycle
I delved into the Terraform lifecycle, understanding the roles of `init`, `plan`, and `apply` commands.

### Launching an EC2 Instance
I took a big step by provisioning an EC2 instance on AWS, exploring attributes such as instance type, AMI, and tags.

### Terraform State Basics
I learned about the importance of Terraform state files in maintaining infrastructure consistency.

## Day 2: Advanced Terraform Configuration

I deepened my knowledge of Terraform by exploring providers and resources, and mastering variables and outputs. I also learned to add logic to my code with conditional expressions and functions, and I gained skills in debugging and formatting Terraform files.

## Day 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Modules

This day was all about efficiency and reusability, where I created and utilized Terraform modules, simplifying complex expressions with local values and data sources.

## Day 4: Collaboration and State Management

I focused on effective collaboration using Git and managing sensitive data securely. I also implemented S3 as a backend for remote state storage and explored state locking with DynamoDB.

## Day 5: Provisioning and Provisioners

I explored the use of provisioners to execute specific actions on resources during their lifecycle and learned about managing provisioner failures effectively.

## Day 6: Managing Environments with Workspaces

Workspaces were a key focus, where I learned to manage different environments by creating and switching between workspaces.

## Day 7: Security and Advanced Topics

The final day brought me to advanced security topics where I learned about HashiCorp Vault for secret management and how to integrate Terraform with Vault for secure configurations.
